# Tensorflow implementation of LSTM based sentiment analysis with attention layer
Bag of Words vs. Bag of Popcorn as an example 

This is an extension of the previous project (lstm_word2vec). Now we have a tensorflow implementation of LSTM for the purpose of sentiment analysis, with the option of adding an attention layer. 

In this project, I reused the I/O function and data prep functions from lstm_word2vec.  

The major improvements are: 
1. Migration of code from keras to TF. 
2. Added an optional attention layer plus visualization. 
3. Added a batch generator class that can be easily used for different datasets.  

The main_lstm.ipynb show cases how to leverage existing functions to train your own LSTM + attention layer model. 

Addition of the attention layer appears to marginally improve the results of the testing set. But further testing is needed to establish the significance of the improvement...
